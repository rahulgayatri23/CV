\begin{resume} 
%\section{A short introduction}
%%For Deutche Bank. 
%The multidiscplinary and challanging area of computer science has taught me to find innovative and efficient solutions to a given problem. 
%Work in R\&D did not only provide an in depth-knowledge in the areas of mathematics, engineering and CS, but has also given me valuable insight into problem analysis, solution design, rapid prototyping as well as into effective collabortion with other engineers.
%%My objective is to use the analytical and problem solving skills acquired during the course of my studies in finding solution to a given problem. 
%My objective is to explore career opportunities in diverse fields and apply there the knowledge gained from my education. 
%%
%\section{Objective} 
%To work in the field of High Performance Computing and parallel programming so that I can use my previous knowledge and experience. 
%I would like to work on finding innovative methods to parallelize algorithms so that they can take better advantage of the rapidly growing hardware performance. 
%I am interested in the development of compiler and runtimes for parallel programming models.

\section{Projects} 
{\bf Doctoral Thesis} \\
%A detailed analysis of speculation based optimistic techniques for synchronization of multiple threads in parallel programing. 
Research  the idea of integrating Transactional Memory into a Parallel Programming Model and use the framework to synchronize the multiple threads of execution. 
This optimistic approach has been adopted to improve the performance and the efficiency of a parallel application.\\ 
Papers published in this project: papers [1],[2] and [3] .\\\\
%
{\bf StarSs}\\
A task-based programming model to make parallel programming easier. It generates a task-dependency graph at runtime based on the data-flow principles. 
My contribution to the thesis was to introduce new directives to the compiler and provide the required runtime support for the synchronization of multiple threads. \\\\
%
{\bf Teraflux}  \\
Teraflux project proposes a set of programming model, compiler analysis and a scalable, reliable architecture that will be able to harness such large scale parallelism in an efficient way.
My contribution to the project was to introduce STM-based concurrency to handle simultaneous access to shared memory.\\
Papers published in this project: paper [4].\\\\
%
{\bf MTech Thesis} \\
An efficient Breadth First Search (BFS) implementation that exploits memory locality in the IBM's Cell.B.E architecture. \\ 
A poster presenting this work was published in the student research symposium of HiPC 2008, Banglore, India.
